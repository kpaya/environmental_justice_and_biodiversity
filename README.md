# Unequal Exposure: Redlining’s Legacy on Los Angeles’ Environmental Health and Biodiversity

## About

This repository contains an analysis of the impact of historical redlining on environmental health and biodiversity in Los Angeles. Key functions in this repository handle the processing and analysis of the datasets, comparing biodiversity data between redlined and non-redlined areas, and assessing how redlining correlates with environmental justice indicators such as pollution levels, low-income percentage, and life expectancy percentage

Visualizations, such as comparison maps and charts, have been created to highlight disparities in biodiversity data distribution and environmental health indicator.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

/data: Contains the raw datasets used in the analysis

README.md: This file provides an overview of the repository and how to use it.

exploring_environmental_injustice_project.qmd: Quarto document containing the analysis, including data wrangling, comparison between redlined and non-redlined areas, and visualizations.

## Data

1. The data used in this project comes from:
EJScreen is a tool provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that offers detailed environmental and demographic data for the United States, available at both the Census tract and block group levels. The dataset used in this study specifically contains data at the block group level, providing a granular view of environmental justice indicators across communities. Please note that due to the large file size, the EJScreen dataset cannot be included in this repository. You will need to download the required files directly from the source, the link is provided below.

2. The Mapping Inequality project, led by the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond, has digitized historical maps and data from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) redlining surveys. This files related to this dataset can be found under the /data folder.

3. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is the largest aggregator of biodiversity observations worldwide. The dataset includes information on species sightings, typically recording the location and date of each observation. Please note that due to the large file size, this dataset cannot be included in this repository. The file can be downloaded directly from the source, the link is provided below.
